# Testing Github Copilot Cli
This repo has been entirely pushed by github copilot cli. Had a blast changing names of each file again and again and what was more fun was that I didnt have to worry about writing the wrong bash command and the fear of losing my data or files.  

## Installation
`brew install copilot-cli`

## Run copilot in bash
`copilot`

### Why github copilot cli?
> Lesser mistakes
> No data loss (or code loss)
> Easy to commit, create a pull request or push changes to repo
